-- M4: seeds the example_extraction task's prompt into prompt_versions
-- so llm.call({task: "example_extraction", ...}) has a real active
-- row to read. This is a minimal, genuinely useful first task (not a
-- placeholder with no purpose): structured extraction of claims/
-- benefits/objections/audience from free text, which spec §5.4 names
-- directly ("a Claude call extracts claims, benefits, objections and
-- audience into a draft brief") — the real M5 task this will become
-- once M5 builds the brief form; seeded now so M4's golden-file test
-- has a real task to pin against, not a throwaway one.
--
-- Not a numbered migration — re-runnable content, same as
-- seed_styles.sql/seed_models.sql.
