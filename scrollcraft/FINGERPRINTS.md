# Fingerprints

Every site you build with **scroll-craft** gets one row here, appended after it
ships. The registry exists so your next build can prove it is a different page
rather than a re-skin of one you already made.

This file is **yours**. It starts empty on purpose: the gate is about not
repeating *yourself*, so it has nothing to say until you have built something.

The rules and the gate live in the skill's
`references/uniqueness.md`. Short version:

**A new build must differ from EVERY row below on at least 4 of the 6
dimensions.** Four against each row individually, not four on average across the
table. If a planned build fails, change the plan. Never edit a row to make room
for it.

The six dimensions are: **grammar**, **nav treatment**, **hero device**,
**act-sequence shape**, **close pattern**, **signature move**.

Dimension 6 is free, because a signature move is unique by definition. So the
gate really asks for three more out of the remaining five, and a build that
changes only grammar and world will fail it.

## The registry

| Build | Grammar | Nav treatment | Hero device | Act-sequence shape | Close pattern | Signature move | World | Port |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| autocut-studio | Live surface | App chrome: the product's nine-step stepper is the nav, plus a status bar carrying gate state | Surface already in a state: three script cards travel from a foreground plane into their slots over a parallax desk and workspace | pin 1.6 > flow+reveal > pin 3.0 (peak, dark ground) > flow+in > pin 1.2; 5 acts, 7.8vh | First-run form (agency setup) with a cursor in it, approval carried into the request | The human gate: export stays locked until the visitor presses Approve; editing the storyboard after approval re-locks it | Product UI on paper ground, one orange hue in two lightnesses | scrollcraft/builds/autocut-studio |

*(empty: your first build has nothing to clear, so build whatever the interview
points at. From the second onwards, this table is the constraint.)*

## What is taken

Add a bullet here whenever a build claims something a later build should avoid
reusing: a grammar, a nav treatment, a close pattern, a signature move, an
act-count-and-length band. The shared columns are what the next build inherits
as a constraint, so writing them down is the whole point.

- Live surface grammar with a stepper-as-nav (autocut-studio).
- The human-gate signature move: content locked until the visitor approves (autocut-studio).
- 5 acts at about 7.8vh, pin/flow alternating.

## Appending a row

After shipping, add one line to the table and one bullet to **What is taken** if
the build claimed something new. Fill every column. Say what the build shares
with existing rows.

Rows are append-only. A build that has been superseded stays in the table,
because the space it occupies is still occupied.

## Worked example

The skill's author kept a registry of twelve builds across eight page grammars.
If you want to see what a filled-in table looks like, and which shapes tend to
collide, read `EXAMPLES.md` in the scroll-craft repository. Treat it as
illustration only: those rows are somebody else's builds and they do **not**
constrain yours.
